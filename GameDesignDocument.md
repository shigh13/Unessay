# Summary

**"Humanizing Canada's Colonial Legacy" is not exactly a game, but rather an experience that bridges the gaps between digital and physical, past and present.**

"Humanizing Canada's Colonial Legacy" consists of twelve carefully chosen audio clips that cover a broad range of issues concerning colonialism in Canada over the past half century. These audio clips are exclusively voiced by Indigenous people and range in mediums from poetry to song to documentary. By dropping the audio clips around the Centennial Flame, one not only draws the clear linkage to the memorial to the 215 victims of the Kamloops Residential School from the Summer of 2021, but also brings the subject of neo-colonialism and its effects today to the forefront while standing in the shadow of the Canadian Parliament. The clips are dropped in the area around the flame and there is no linear order to listen to them in, which will make each person's experience a uniques one. The clips also overlap with each other and grow louder at their centres to demonstrate both the temporal interconnectedness of the stories and to make each clip imitate a person telling the story in real life.

# Core

## Design pillars 

1. Movement
2. Listening
3. Learning
4. Feeling

## Game loops 

The only loop in the experience comes at its conclusion, when all twelve clips have been listened to.

## Player motivation and progression 

The four key player motivations in this experience are learning, listening, moving, and feeling. The only progression that can be measured is subjective to each individual to "play" the experience: what they learn and what they feel.

# Features

## Sound Mapping

This is the only real feature of this experience, and it thus plays a tremedous role. By playing specific sounds/clips when the playeris standing in a specific geographic location, and thus linking place with sound and movement with changing sounds, sound mapping is a powerful and versatile tool. Because it is not a perfect science and does not correspond to placing audio clips on the correct location to the inch, one must walk around a little bit to discover all the sounds, rather than rely on the map in the Echoes app. This is especially true for this project, as all the sounds are in one constrained area rather than dispersed in a large one or placed sequentially in a line. This encourages the player to walk around the game area more and to figure out its geographic limits for themselves.

# Content

This is the content of your game. They‚Äôre things that can change depending on where the player is at in the game. Depending on the type of game you‚Äôre making you might not need all of these pages or they might look very different.

**Sound**

This is an auditory experience first and foremost. Movement and space are also crucial, but sound is the key component. Each clip features not only differnt voices, but different mediums, as well. There are interviews, there are songs, there are poems, there are documentaries. They all tell stories of experiences with colonial systmes but from different perspectives and in different methods.

**Characters**

The twelve clips are from twelve different voices about twelve different events, experiences, and perspectives. There are a few clips with multiple voices (the Obomsawin documentary clip specifically) but each clip and each voice brings unique emotions and perspectives, which demonstrates the different interpretations of events and structures, as well as the personalities of each speaker.
